## PES University - CSE - Notes & Resources

Welcome to my curation of notes and resources for PESU (first year BTech and CSE semesters). I have tried to include as many relevant sources as I have been able to find and curated them over the semesters. I do not update the resources every year so be sure to check the syllabus of your current semester against what I have uploaded here.

I have included `README`s in each semester's subfolder and I request you to read the same before using the resources and/or emailing me, as your questions might be answered there. I am really happy with the responses I have received due to this and hope to continue maintaining this repository.

I would also like to mention that I am not a teacher but a student. I have not uploaded notes for every single unit of every single subject. I do not appreciate mails asking me to send notes personally, if they have not been uploaded. I try my best to upload everything but I make no promises.

Feel free to email me/open a pull request if I have missed uploading any slides of an existing subject, or if there are any mistakes. I am always happy to add any resources that you may have found/made to this repository if you open a pull request or send them to me.
