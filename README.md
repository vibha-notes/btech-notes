## PES University - CSE - Notes & Resources

Welcome to my curation of notes and resources for PESU (first year BTech and CSE semesters). I have tried to include as many relevant sources as I have been able to find and curated them over the semesters. I do not update the resources every year so be sure to check the syllabus of your current semester against what I have uploaded here.

I have included `README`s in each semester's subfolder and I request you to read the same before using the resources and/or emailing me, as your questions might be answered there. I am really happy with the responses I have received due to this and hope to continue maintaining this repository.

## Contributing

I am always happy to add any resources that you may have found/made to this repository. Fork this repository, clone it, add your resources and open a pull request, and I would be happy to add them.
