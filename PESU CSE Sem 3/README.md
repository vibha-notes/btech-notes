## Sem 3 (2020) - Notes & Resources

I have included my class notes (handwritten and code, depending on the subject) as well as the resources provided by teachers (ppts and pdfs). **NOTE: I DO NOT CLAIM THESE NOTES TO BE SUFFICIENT!!**

I have tried to include most of the course content here, but this is meant to act only as a reference and not as a guide to the semester. The contents of this folder are valid as of 2020 and will not be updated every year. Still, I hope this serves as a good reference as I have worked hard to create and maintain it.

With regards to my class notes, they are not perfect and might have mistakes, but I hope this  will make your studying easier. If you find any mistakes/have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to **open an issue**.

If my notes of a subject have not been uploaded yet and the syllabus has been covered, chances are that I will not be uploading my class notes for that subject/unit. Still I have tried to include all of the material sent to us by the professors. I do not guarantee that I have uploaded everything necessary for the course.

## Searching Through Notes

You can search my handwritten class notes' pdfs for words as handwriting is recognised, and searching works like it does in any other text-based pdf.
