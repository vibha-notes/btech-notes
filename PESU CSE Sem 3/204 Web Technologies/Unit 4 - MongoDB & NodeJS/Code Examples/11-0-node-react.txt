NodeJS integration with ReactJS

1. HTML file - containig react code
Request for .html or .css - return file back - browser will execute

2. React app approach
Execute react code at server end
    1. npx create-react-app myapp
    2. cd myapp
        scr -> index.js and App.js
    3. npm start 
        (starts server and waits for client connections)

React Router:

SPA 
    - fewer page loads
    - fewer requests to server
    - faster page speeds

Regular app
    - <a> - navigation/request being sent to server
    - server side routing

Client side routing
    - link component
