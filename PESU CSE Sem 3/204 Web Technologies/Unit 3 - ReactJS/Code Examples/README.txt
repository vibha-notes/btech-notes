### Web Technologies - Unit 3

Disclaimer: these notes are for purely educational purposes and are 
not to be printed and sold anywhere. 

I have included my code examples from the class (as much and as 
accurately as I could) as well as the resources provided by teachers 
(ppts and pdfs). I have added a single picture to the images folder.

I have also included my class notes as a pdf in the folder outside
this, if you are interested.

I do not promise that 100% of the code works/is bug-free and might 
have mistakes, but I hope this will make your studying easier, 
whoever you are :)

If you find any mistakes/have any suggestions or feedback, do 
contact me.
