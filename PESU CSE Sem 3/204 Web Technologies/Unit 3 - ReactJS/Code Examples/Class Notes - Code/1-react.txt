Issues while building SPAs

1. In SPAs, bulk of time in keeping data in sync with UI
2. DOM manipulation is slow (pre-traversal)
3. Working with HTML templates is a pain

React

1. FaceBook and Instagram released React
2. Automatic UI State Management
2. Fast DOM Manipulation (virtual DOM - updates 
   actual DOM only when required with least
   amount of changes)
3. APIs to create component-based UIs (modular
   UI elements used to build more complex elements)
4. Visuals defined entirely in JS (can use JSX that 
   gets converted to JavaScript - Babel)
