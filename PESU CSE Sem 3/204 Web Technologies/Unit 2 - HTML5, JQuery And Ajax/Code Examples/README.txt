### Web Technologies - Unit 2

Disclaimer: these notes are for purely educational purposes and are 
not to be printed and sold anywhere. 

I have included my code examples from the class (as much and as 
accurately as I could) as well as the resources provided by teachers 
(ppts and pdfs). I have not included media into the images, video and 
audio folders and if you want to test out the code, I suggest adding 
your own media. I do not promise that 100% of the code works/is bug-free

This code is not perfect and might have mistakes, but I hope this 
will make your studying easier, whoever you are :)

If you find any mistakes/have any suggestions or feedback, do 
contact me.
