### Special Topic

Disclaimer: these notes are for purely educational purposes and are 
not to be printed and sold anywhere. 

Note: I have not made any class notes any of the special topics except
around 4-5 pages of Java (introduction).

I have included my code examples from class (Java) and the code/
lessons for the subjects that I could find resources for on pesuacademy.
I do not have any more notes for these subjects, but if you have/find 
anything, feel free to send it to me :)
