/*
inheritance and composition:
Inheritance : should follow Liskov's property of substitution
- should be able to replace an object of super class by object of sub class
- interface of the super class should also be interface of the sub class

Inheritance:
is a relation between class
"IS A" relationship

we use inheritance to avoid if statement based on the value of an attribute
We create a relationship of type and subtype - called a class hierarchy
- you may quote examples from automobiles or taxonomy.
- commonality between classes (both attributes and behaviour) are captured
in the superclass

- we can replace an object of superclass by an object of subclass. call to methods
using superclass interface is dispatched to subclass method - behaviour called 
polymorphism. Adding a new class or new type does not break the existing code.

Compositon:
is a relation between objects
"HAS A" relationship
