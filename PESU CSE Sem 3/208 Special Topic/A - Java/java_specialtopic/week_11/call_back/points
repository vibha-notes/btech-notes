Callback in Java : concept of a callback function does not exist in Java because Java doesnâ€™t have pointer concept. 
However, there are situations where one could speak of a callback object or a callback interface. Instead of passing the 
memory address of a function, interface is passed that refers to the location of a function.

//inner class
//	anonymous inner class
//		used to implement a callback
//		cannot have a ctor
//		extends the class whose object is being created
//		can downcast in the heirarchy
//		can override methods of the super class
//		can have attributes
//		should not introduce new methods
