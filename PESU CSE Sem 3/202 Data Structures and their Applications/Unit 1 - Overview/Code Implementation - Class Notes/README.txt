### Data Structures - Unit 1

Disclaimer: these notes are for purely educational purposes and are 
not to be printed and sold anywhere. 

I have included my code examples from the class (as much and as 
accurately as I could) as well as the resources provided by teachers 
(ppts and pdfs). I have not uploaded the code that the professors
have sent (except 05 Matrix->multilist.c). I do not have a notes 
pdf for this unit.

This code is not perfect and might have mistakes, but I hope this 
will make your studying easier, whoever you are :)

If you find any mistakes/have any suggestions or feedback, do 
contact me.
