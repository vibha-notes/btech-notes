#Here the division results in the lower integer to the value.
#this operator works starting in 2.2 and does not require the __future__ directive

#To determine the order of evaluation when operator precedence is same we use Operator Associativity.
#Operator Associativity defines the direction in which operators of same
#precedence are evaluated, it can be either from left to right or right to left.
#Operators within same group have same associativity.


#The following are two noteworthy points to remember about the precedence table.
#Associativity of most operators in the same group is from left to right except exponentiation(**).
#The associativity of exponentiation operator (**) is from right to left.
# parentheses i.e () can be used to change the order of evaluation.

#ADDITIONAL INFO

#In Python 3.5 and higher, we can also use the defined constants math.inf and math.nan:
pos_inf = math.inf
neg_inf = -math.inf
not_a_num = math.nan
print(pos_inf,neg_inf,not_a_num)

print(sys.float_info.max)               #this is system dependent value
print(pos_inf<sys.float_info.max)

#Arithmetic operations on infinity just give infinite results, or sometimes NaN
print(-5.0 * pos_inf == neg_inf)               #True
print(-5.0 * neg_inf == pos_inf)               #True
print(pos_inf * neg_inf == neg_inf)            #True
print(0.0 * pos_inf)                          #nan
print(0.0 * neg_inf)                           #nan
print(pos_inf / pos_inf)                       #nan


#NaN is never equal to anything, not even itself. We can test for it is with the isnan method:
print(not_a_num == not_a_num)
# Out: False

print(math.isnan(not_a_num))
#Out: True

#NaN always compares as "not equal", but never less than or greater than:

print(not_a_num != 5.0)   # or any random value
# Out: True

print(not_a_num > 5.0   or   not_a_num < 5.0   or   not_a_num == 5.0)
# Out: False

#Arithmetic operations on NaN always give NaN. This includes multiplication by -1: there is no "negative NaN".

print(5.0 * not_a_num)
# Out: nan

#print(float("abc")) #ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'abc'

print(float("nan"))
