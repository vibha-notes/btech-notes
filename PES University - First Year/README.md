## Year 1 (2019-20) - Class Notes

Disclaimer: these notes are for purely educational purposes and are not to be printed and sold anywhere.

I have included my class notes as well as the resources provided by teachers (ppts and pdfs) with some assignments. 

## Note

I DO NOT CLAIM THESE NOTES TO BE SUFFICIENT!! But I have made my best effort to include most of the course content for the year 2019-2020 here.

With regards to my class notes, they are not perfect and might have mistakes, and I do not claim them to be perfect, but I hope this will make your studying easier, whoever you are :)

If you find any mistakes/have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to contact me and I will try my best to respond. I have not updated the contents of this folder to reflect changes in syllabus year on year. As of 2019-20, this folder is up to date.

You may search my class e-notes' pdfs for words as handwriting is recognised and searching for words works like it does in any other pdf.
